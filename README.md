## Running Locally

To get the app running locally for development and testing purposes, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Node.js installed on your local machine
- NPM (comes bundled with Node.js) or Yarn

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/jonesmatr/React-Portfolio.git
```

2. Change into the directory of the cloned repository:
```shell
cd React-Portfolio
```

3. Install dependencies:
```shell
npm install
```

4. Start the development server:
```shell
npm start
```

Now, open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the app in your browser. The page will reload automatically when you make changes to the code.

### Building for Production

To build the app for production, use the following command:

```shell
npm run build
```

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for cache management.
